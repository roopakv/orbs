  This command waits for another job in this workflow. Since right now Circle CI doesnt let
  you queue up jobs irrespective of whether they fail or not. This is a faux queue where
  the command stalls till the other job succeeds.

parameters:
  job-name:
    description: The job on which to wait. If job not found continue immediately
    type: string
  max-wait-time:
    description: |
      The max wait time in seconds a job should wait for before killing itself.
    type: string
    default: "1800"
  kill-gracefully:
    description: If true and time exceeds max wait time, completes and lets future steps continue
    type: string
    default: "true"
  sleep-time-between-checks:
    description: How long to sleep between checks.
    type: string
    default: "30"
  run-on-branch:
    description: |
      The branches to actually wait on. By default this waits on all branches. If set to anything but
      '*' the wait will run only on the specified branch
    type: string
    default: "*"

steps:
  - run:
      name: Swissknife - Wait for job in workflow
