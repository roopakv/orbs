description: |
  This command waits for running workflows of a kind on a given branch to complete. Adding This
  as the first step in a job will make the job wait till it is the only running workflow.
  This requires a Circle CI token be set as $CIRCLE_TOKEN

parameters:
  branch-to-consider:
    description: The branch on which we will wait for workflows. If set to "all" this will wait across all branches
    type: string
    default: master
  max-wait-time:
    description: |
      The max wait time in seconds a job should wait for before killing itself.
    type: string
    default: "600"
  kill-gracefully:
    description: If true and time exceeds max wait time, dies without failing the job
    type: string
    default: "true"
  workflow-name:
    description: The type of workflows to wait for. This can be a regex
    type: string
    default: "*"
  vcs-type:
    description: What is the VCS for this project
    type: string
    default: github
  sleep-time-between-checks:
    description: How long to sleep between checks.
    type: string
    default: "30"
  run-on-branch:
    description: |
      The branches to actually wait on. By default this waits on all branches. If set to anything but
      '*' the wait will run only on the specified branch
    type: string
    default: "*"
  repo-name:
    description: The environment variable that holds the workflows repo. Defaults to the calling repo.
    type: env_var_name
    default: CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME

steps:
  - run:
      name: Swissknife - Wait for workflows
