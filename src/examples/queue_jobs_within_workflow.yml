  This command waits for another job in this workflow. Since right now Circle doesnt let
  you queue up jobs irrespective of whether they fail or not. This is a faux queue where
  the command stalls till the other job succeeds.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    swissknife: roopakv/swissknife@x.y

  jobs:
    second-job:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/node:latest
      working_directory: /home/circleci/project
      steps:
        - swissknife/wait_for_job:
            job-name: "First job name"
        - run:
            name: Run after first job
            command: |
              echo "This code will run only after first job is finished (either successfully or failure)"
