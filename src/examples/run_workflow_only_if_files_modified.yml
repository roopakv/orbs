  Triggers a workflow if directory / file is modified. Continues if not. In this
  example, we have two pipeline vars run_main_workflow and trigger_other_workflow, the
  main workflow  has a job called some-job which runs another workflow for
  integration tests. It is set up this way since we dont want to run integration tests for every change

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    swissknife: roopakv/swissknife@x.y

  jobs:
    trigger-needed-workflows:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/node:latest
      steps:
        - checkout
        - swissknife/trigger_pipeline_if_modified:
            always-trigger-on-branch: master
            custom-parameters: '{"run_main_workflow": false, "run_custom_integration_tests": true}'
            pattern: ^(directory|\.circleci).*
            use-divergence-point: true
